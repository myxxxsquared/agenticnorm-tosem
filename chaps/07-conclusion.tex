\section{Conclusion}

We presented \lighttechname, a lightweight framework for detecting web tamper attacks that combines field clustering, attack generation, and prompt refinement to make small, locally deployable LLMs effective. 
Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves the best overall F1-score, with each component contributing to performance gains, and remains robust across models of different scales. 
Our results highlight that careful architectural design is essential, as naïve substitution of large models with smaller ones leads to significant performance degradation.
