\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented \lighttechname, a lightweight and locally deployable framework for detecting web tamper attacks from logs. By combining field clustering, adversarial attack generation, and iterative prompt refinement in a multi-agent workflow, \lighttechname addresses key limitations of prior approaches, including dependence on source code, reliance on heavyweight proprietary models, and sensitivity to prompt design. Our evaluation on TrainTicket and NiceFish demonstrates that \lighttechname achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining robust across different LLM scales.

Looking ahead, we aim to enable \lighttechname to adapt continuously as web applications evolve, allowing it to handle changing APIs and attack patterns with minimal retraining. We also plan to explore transfer and meta-learning techniques so that invariants and refined prompts learned from one system can be effectively reused in new applications, improving both efficiency and generalization across domains.
