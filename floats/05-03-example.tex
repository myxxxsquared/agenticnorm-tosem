        An example from \trainticket demonstrating how prompt refinement enhances the quality of generated constraints.
        The left panel illustrates a simplified attack case. The two middle panels show the generated attacks and the refined prompt, which incorporates additional range constraints compared to the original version. The right panel presents the resulting constraints.
