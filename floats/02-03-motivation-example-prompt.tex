    \caption{An illustration of different prompts. The left panel shows the original prompt used in WebNorm, which relies on manually crafted instructions and examples, making prompt adjustment highly labor-intensive. The middle panel adds new instructions to the original prompt, guiding the LLM to generate abnormal logs. The right panel presents the refined prompt, which is able to capture a broader set of invariants.}
