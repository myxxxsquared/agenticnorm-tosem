    \caption{ A motivating example from the \trainticket dataset illustrates a ticket refund workflow, 
where the user first retrieves a list of orders using \texttt{queryOrders} and then requests a refund through \texttt{cancelOrder}. 
The blue highlights indicate identifiers that should match across the two APIs, while the red highlight marks an abnormal tampering, 
where the \texttt{orderId} is replaced with a value not present in the queried list.
