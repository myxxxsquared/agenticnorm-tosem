%         API3        & Broken Object Property Level Authorization      & Used. focuses on tampering with specific fields in objects.                           \\

%         API5        & Broken Function Level Authorization             & Used. attack logs where high-privilege functions are exposed to low-privilege actors. \\

%         API9        & Improper Inventory Management                   & Excluded. relies on large-scale endpoint enumeration patterns.                        \\
%         API10       & Unsafe Consumption of APIs                      & Used. synthesizes attack logs involving unvalidated or malicious upstream data.       \\

    \caption{OWASP API Security Top 10 categories used in our framework.
    We exclude API4 (Unrestricted Resource Consumption) and API9 (Improper Inventory Management) 
    because both rely on frequency or large-scale traffic/endpoint modeling, which is beyond the scope of our log-based analysis
