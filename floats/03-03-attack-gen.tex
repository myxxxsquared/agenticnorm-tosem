        API1        & Broken Object Level Authorization               & Used. generates abnormal logs where access control invariants are bypassed.             \\
        API2        & Broken Authentication                           & Used. simulates login/session anomalies not captured by current invariants.             \\
        API3        & Broken Object Property Level Authorization      & Used. focuses on tampering with specific fields in objects.                             \\
