    \caption{An illustration of relation between prompt and generated invariants in WebNorm.
        The left panel shows the prompt, which relies on manually crafted instructions and examples. Adjusting such prompts is labor-intensive and they often lack generalizability across diverse scenarios.
        The right panel illustrates the corresponding invariants generated from the prompt. The highlighted regions reveal the direct mapping between the prompt instructions and the generated constraints. Importantly, the generated invariants strictly adhere to the specified prompt and are limited to the constraint types explicitly mentioned.
